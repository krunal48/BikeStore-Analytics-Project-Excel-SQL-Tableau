### Source Tables (SQL)
The original data resides in multiple tables (provided in the SQL Server database), including:
- **Orders**
- **Customers**
- **Products**
- **Categories**
- **Brands**
- **Stores**

### Final Dataset (Consolidated Table)
After integrating the tables using SQL, the final dataset contains the following fields:
- **order_id**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **customers**: Customer names or IDs.
- **city**: City where the purchase occurred.
- **state**: State where the purchase occurred.
- **order_date**: Date of the order.
- **total_units**: Total units sold in an order.
- **revenue**: Total revenue generated from the order.
- **product_name**: Name of the product sold.
- **category_name**: Product category (e.g., bikes, accessories).
- **brand_name**: Brand of the product.
- **store_name**: Store where the purchase was made.
- **sales_rep**: Sales representative responsible for the order.
